# Hi Diarmuid,
#
# To run the code for assignment1 please load the main.py file like so:
#
#
# cd <Project_dir>
# python main.py
#
# All custom code resides in the src folder if you require further analysis. Some of the plotting procedures from
# matplotlib I did need help with from online resources but the majority > 90% of the code is original using the scipy
# stack.
#
# I have added a list of required libraries in the PDF report along with the version number I used.
#
# I also documented key parts of the codebase to the best of my ability. If it is not documented it has little effect on
# the code pipeline for the assignment, if you have any questions please contact me via email.
#
# Cheers,
# Dave.
