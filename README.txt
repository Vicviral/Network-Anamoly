# Hi Moosa,
#
# To run the code please load the main.py file like so:
#
#
# cd <Project_dir>
# python main.py
#
# All custom code resides in the src folder if you require further analysis. Some of the plotting procedures from
# matplotlib I did need help with from online resources but the majority > 90% of the code is original using the scipy
# stack.
#
# Cheers,
# Victor.
